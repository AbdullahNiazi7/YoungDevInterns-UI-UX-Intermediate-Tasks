🍔 UI/UX Case Study – Week 2: Food Delivery App (Intermediate Tasks)
This repository contains my intermediate-level UI/UX design tasks for Week 2 as part of my internship at @YoungDev. The project focuses on improving the user experience of a food delivery app tailored to the needs of a busy university student in Pakistan.

📌 What I Did
👤 User Persona
Crafted a detailed persona — Muhammad Abdullah Khan, a 20-year-old student from Islamabad who needs fast, affordable meals between classes. This helped me empathize with real-world needs and shape user-centered decisions.

🔄 User Flow
Mapped out a streamlined flow that guides the user from opening the app to successfully placing a food order, ensuring a smooth and frustration-free journey.

🧱 Wireframes
Designed 3 core wireframes that visualize key screens of the app experience:

📱 Home/Restaurant Discovery

🛒 Cart/Checkout

🚚 Order Tracking

Each wireframe was built with simplicity, usability, and quick access in mind — ideal for users in a hurry.

🧠 Key Learnings
Focused on real user pain points like complex checkout and poor tracking.

Understood how personas influence design direction.

Practiced clean, low-fidelity wireframing for quick ideation.
